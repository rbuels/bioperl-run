 Title   : new()
 Usage   : my $splitter = Bio::Tools::Run::PiseApplication::splitter->new($location, $email, @params);
 Function: Creates a Bio::Tools::Run::PiseApplication::splitter object.
           This method should not be used directly, but rather by 
           a Bio::Tools::Run::AnalysisFactory::Pise instance.
           my $factory = Bio::Tools::Run::AnalysisFactory::Pise->new();
           my $splitter = $factory->program('splitter');
 Example : -
 Returns : An instance of Bio::Tools::Run::PiseApplication::splitter.
