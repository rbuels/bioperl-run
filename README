This is where modules which wrap around running various applications
are stored.  See the Changes file for more information about what is
contained in here.  The installation of this package is identical to
the core bioperl install.

Essentially

   % perl Makefile.PL
   % make
   % make test (some tests may not succeed if you do not have the necessary
	        programs or env variables defined)
   % su
   # make install
